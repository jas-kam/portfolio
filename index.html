                    This poster was created for the 17th Lovelace at Liverpool, getting the People's Choice Award. 
                    The concept was to make people aware of Third Party Cookies. It was a surprise to see how many people accepted cookies without knowing the consequences it could hold.

                    based off of their chosen graph. All they would need to do is input their values they want plotted
                    and pick an option of how they want to represent their data: Scatter Graph, Histogram, Boxplot.
